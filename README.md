# CoinTossInvestmentManagerFBRChap9
Overview: 
A recreation of the Investment Manger Monte Carlo Coin Flip scenario
mentioned in chapter 9 of Nassim Taleb's book Fooled By Randomness.
We start with 10k investment managers. Each year they have a 50% change to profit $10k
and a 50% chance to lose $10k. If they lose they are eliminated from the sample size.
Taleb shows that after five years we end up having 313 investment managers 
that won five years in a row just by luck. 
My most recent run of this program shows 305 very lucky investment managers.
